    <h2>Introduction
    </h2>

	<p>
		After stating that we are PhD students working at <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs/"> The Center for the Study of Complex Systems </a> (CSCS) at the University of Michigan a common question we both get is, "What is complex systems?" Easy question, right? Just describe the focus of CSCS. This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task. CSCS doesn't have a single focus and complex systems is a broad and interdisciplinary subject. The definition of what a complex system is varies based on who you ask and what you read. This is the motivation behind this article. To start, here is our attempt at a rough definition. A <i> complex system </i> is a set of interacting parts that collectively form interesting global structures and patterns. Some common examples include the brain, an economy, immune system, and ecosystems.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this article we will to describe some common characteristics of complex systems. We will explore some of these characeristics in the context of the flocking behavior of birds.
    </p>

	<h2> Common Characteristics of Complex System </h2>
	<p>
		An exact definition of a complex system does not exist. This is due to the numerous disciplines the study covers. Here at the UM, CSCS core faculty spans sociology, physics, math, political science, economics, engineering, school of information, and public policy. The list grows even larger when you include affiliated faculty members. That being said, there are some common characteristics of complex system that exist among these various areas of study. Here is a list of common features and their descriptions:
		<ul>
		  <li><p> <b>Non-Linearity:</b>
			  A sytem exhibits <i>non-linearity</i> when it's behavior can not be fully understood by inspecting it's individual parts alone. Another way of stating this is that a change on the component level doesn't result in a proportional change on the system level.
		  </p></li>
		  <li><p><b>Emergence:</b>
			  These systems

		  <li><p><b>Self Organization:</b>
		  </p></li>
		  <li><p><b>Collective Behavior:</b>
		  </p></li>
		</ul>

    <h2>Flocking
    </h2>
    <p>
    We will now discuss flocking to illustrate the features of a complex system. This is now a canonical complex system. Craig Reynolds (1987) produced perhaps the first-widely known simulation of flocking. The model used three simple rules: seperation, cohesion, and alighnment. These rules were similar to those used in a earlier simulation done by Aoki (1982) for modeling fish schools. A quantitative study of flocking was introduced by Vicsek (1995) using methods from statistical physics. The model studied in Vicsek's 1995 paper is know widely known as the "Vicsek model".
    </p>

    <p>
    The Vicsek model is described by the following rules:
    $$\theta_{i} (t + \Delta t) =  \langle \theta \rangle_{ |r_{i}-r_{j}| < r } + \eta_{i}(t)$$
    $$ \mathbf{r}_{i} (t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{r}_{i} (t) + v \Delta t \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_i(t) \\ \sin\theta_i(t) \end{pmatrix} $$
    where $\theta$ is the orientation,   $\langle \theta \rangle_{ |r_{i}-r_{j}| < r }$ is the average $\theta$ of all neighboring birds within a radius $r$, $\eta_{i}(t)$ is a noise term,
    $\mathbf{r}_{i}$ is the position of the $i$th bird (or particle),  $\Delta t$ is the time step between updates, and $v$ is the speed of an individual bird.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is useful to specify an order parameter for complex systems that undergo phase transitions. An <i>order parameter</i> is a macroscopic quantity that is an indicator of order and current phase of the system. Typically there are two phases, a disordered vs ordered phase so an order parameter may take the value 0 say for the disordered system and 1 for the ordered system. The values inbetween 0 and 1 may represent a system in transition or in a 'hybrid' state.
</p>
<p>

    For the Vicsek model, the order paramter $ \varphi $ is
    $$ \varphi =  \frac{1}{N v} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{v}_{i}$$
    where $N$ is the number of birds and $\mathbf{v}_{i} = v\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_i(t) \\ \sin\theta_i(t) \end{pmatrix}$ is the velocity of an individual bird. This order paramter indicates if the flock is disordered ($\varphi = 0$) or ordered ($\varphi ~ 1$). When the birds are flying in the same general direction as a whole, this is the ordered state and corresponds to a $\varphi ~ 1$ since the order parameter is simply the ratio of the group speed divided by the indiviudal speed.

            - things to explore...what parameters result in certain behavoirs
            - zero out params one at a time and examine behavior
        - more detailed Vicsek model (has connections to active matter)
