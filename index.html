    <h2>Introduction
    </h2>

	<p>
		After stating that we are PhD students working at <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs/"> The Center for the Study of Complex Systems </a> (CSCS) at the University of Michigan a common follow question we both get is, "What is complex systems?" Easy question, right? Just describe the focus of CSCS. This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task. CSCS doesn't have a single focus and complex systems is a broad and interdisciplinary subject. The definition of what a complex system is varies based on who you ask and what you read. This is the motivation behind this article. While not giving a specific definition, we'd like to describe some common characteristics among definitions. We also help develop an intuition about complex systems via an interactive complex system model that exhibits a lot of the behavior to be described.
    </p>

	<h2> Common Characteristics of Complex System </h2>
	<p>
		As mentioned above, an exact definition of a complex system does not exit. This is due to the numerous disciplines the study covers. Here at the UM, CSCS core faculty spans sociology, physics, math, political science, economics, engineering, school of information, and public policy. The list grows even larger when you include affiliated faculty members. That being said, there are some common characteristics of complex system that exist among these various areas of study. In this section we will highlight some common features. Note, this is not an complete list, but some common reoccurrences we've come across in our studies.

    <p>
    We will now discuss flocking to illustrate the features of a complex system. This is now a canonical complex system. Craig Reynolds (1987) produced perhaps the first-widely known simulation of flocking. The model used three simple rules: seperation, cohesion, and alighnment. These rules were similar to those used in a earlier simulation done by Aoki (1982) for modeling fish schools. A quantitative study of flocking was introduced by Vicsek (1995) using methods from statistical physics. The model studied in Vicsek's 1995 paper is know widely known as the "Vicsek Model".
    </p>

    <p>
    The Vicsek Model is described by the following rules:
    $$\theta_{i} (t + \Delta t) =  \langle \theta \rangle_{ |r_{i}-r_{j}| < r } + \eta_{i}(t)$$

    $$ \mathbf{r}_{i} (t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{r}_{i} (t) + v \Delta t \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_i(t) \\ \sin\theta_i(t) \end{pmatrix} $$
    </p>

            - things to explore...what parameters result in certain behavoirs
            - zero out params one at a time and examine behavior
        - more detailed Vicsek model (has connections to active matter)
