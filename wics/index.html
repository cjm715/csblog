<h1> What exactly <i>is</i>  complex systems science? </h1>
<p size=12pt>Author: Chris Miles</p>

<p>
  As a 5th year physics graduate student working at the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, I am frequently asked, "What is complex systems?" This is a great question and it may seem unsatisfactory but many complex systems researchers would provide you with a wide range of descriptions --- There is definitely not one agreed upon definition. In fact, Melanie Mitchell(a UM Alumna) in her online Course, Introduction to Complexity, interviews and asks 10 complexity scientists this exact question. They all give a variety of answers.
</p>

<p>
  I'll give my own take. <i> A complex systems science seeks to understand systems with many individual parts which collectively interact to produce emergent patterns seen across the entire system.</i> This is admittedly a bit abstract description and honestly, I think its not worth fussing over a clear iron-clad dictionary definition. Complex systems is not the only scientific field that has identity struggles. For instance, the concept of "Life" is ill-defined, but the field that studies this concept, Biology, proceeds undetered from this fact and continues as a well-established and productive discipline.

  I think what is more fruitful is to show few examples of complex systems to better understand the field. Examples come from many different topics such as statistical physics, flocking, ecology, evolutionary biology, computational complexity, information theory, game theory, financial markets, and many others. Here, I will only focus on 3 examples for the sake of brevity. I think this field is naturaly computational and I will share examples with you directly on this page. Ones which can be interacted with --- by poking, dragging, and manipulating this systems in real-time. I'd like to ackowledge that many of the simulations here have been learned through the magnificent teaching of Daniel Schiffman through his book and online youtube tutorial series titled "The Nature of Code". I highly recommend this tutorial for those interested in making similar simulations on their own. I think an interactive component can also help the reader make more sense of these systems.

We begin our exploration by considering a now canonical example of flocking. Click on the empty square below to generate a collection of birds.
