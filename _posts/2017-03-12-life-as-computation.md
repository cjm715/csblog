Could life be viewed as a computation? This perspective is not all too new. DNA provides information which is used to create the machinery of life. This process from DNA to protein can be viewed as computation. What is exactly a computation? We at least have a better chance at defining this than life. Computation is physical first off. Any operation at some level involves the physical manipulation of matter which is interpreted as computation. For instance, a modern day computer is really the manipulation of electrons at its most fundamental level and further abstracted from bits to software.

Computers at the most fundamental level is the manipulation of electrons

Starting at the level of replicators in a soup
to origin of life
systems which could predict or process information to predict or compute the information to predict.
